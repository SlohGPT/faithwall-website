                    <h3>1. THE APPLICATION</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>FaithWall</strong> ("Licensed Application") is a piece of software created to help users organize their goals, reminders, and notes by generating personalized lock-screen wallpapers that make important information instantly visible throughout the day. It is customized for iOS mobile devices ("Devices").
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Application’s main use is to allow users to create, customize, and export wallpapers containing their notes, habits, and reminders using built-in templates and design tools.
                    </p>
                    <p>Furthermore, it is used to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Generate wallpapers through an integrated iOS Shortcut;</li>
                        <li>Provide optional premium features such as advanced templates, unlimited wallpapers, and automation tools;</li>
                        <li>Save user preferences and design settings for easier reuse; and</li>
                        <li>Offer motivational and organizational tools that support consistency and habit building.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The Licensed Application is not tailored to comply with industry-specific regulations (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), etc.), so if your interactions would be subjected to such laws, you may not use this Licensed Application. You may not use the Licensed Application in a way that would violate the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA).
                    </p>
